## Concept:1

1. The image contains steps/instruction along with the display. The image frame is taken in the ratio of 16:9 (an ideal size of the frame for rectangular images). <br>
2. Image Scale: <br>
- **Horizontal spread** 20% on the either side (left & right) of the image is left for writing/viewing instructions (Total measurment= 20%+20% - instructions and 60% image area)<br>
- **Vertical spread** 15% on the either side (top & bottom) of the image is left for writing Title/Caption and Notes respectively<br>
3. The image is saved in the .svg format and zoom feature is enabled

{% image src='pages/features-documentation/images/testimages/imagepocabc.svg' full center alt='Login' zoom %}

## Concept:2

- Different sections created with collapsible and expandible feature. The table-image template is nested inside the **Accordian** sections. The reference to the links and images are used in the similar manner as we use for markdown pages.

<details>
    <summary>
        Prerequisites
    </summary>
    <table>
       <tr>
        <th style="width:35%;">Step</th>
        <th style="width:65%;">Screen</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>1. You are logged in as the administrator<br>2. You are currently on <b>Home</b> page. You want to view, review and analyze content creation or consumption patterns<br>3. You have clicked  <b>Admin Dashboard</b> from the profile drop down 
        </td>
        <td><img src="pages/features-documentation/images/admindashboard/prerequisites.png"></td>
      </tr>
      </table>
    </details>
    
<details>
    <summary>
        Selecting Organization
    </summary>
    <table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width:35%;">Step</th>
    <th style="width:65%;">Screen</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.Click <b>Select Organization</b> from the drop down, to select the organization for which you require the analytics</td>
     <td><img src="pages/features-documentation/images/admindashboard/selectorg.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
    </details>

## Concept: 3


The concept of thumbnail is used here. The instruction scan be written in markdown and image thumbnail can be wrapped around the text. The thumbnail is is clickable and on click, opens in a new tab.


<body>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Enter your <b>Username</b> or <b>Email ID</b> or <b>Phone number</b> <br>2. Enter your <b>Password</b> <br>3. Click <b>Login</b>. Click thumbnail to view UI. <a href="pages/features-documentation/images/testimages/poc_image1.png"  target="_blank"><img src="thumbnail.png"/></a>
		</li>
	</ol>
</body>
