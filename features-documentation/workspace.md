## Overview
There are various user roles on Sunbird. Each user has a unique role to play in their respective organizations. Organization administrators assign one or many responsibilities to users on Sunbird. Extending the literal meaning of workspace, a space to work, Sunbird provides a unique workspace to suit the work needs of each user.  

In this section we discuss the workspace of users who create and curate content on Sunbird.
