<p><strong>Q. How do you get content creation rights on the platform?</strong></p>

<p>The platform has set protocols for user roles and functionalities. The user base follows a certain hierarchy, where the administrators provide rights and permissions to other users, based on need, to accomplish their tasks across the platform.</p>

<p>Strategically, every organization should have designated system administrators, who create and assign rights to organizational administrators, who in turn create roles viz,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Content Creator</li>
  <li>Content Reviewer</li>
  <li>Flag Reviewer</li>
  <li>Course Mentor</li>
  <li>Announcement Sender</li>
  <li>Course creator</li>
  <li>Course Admin</li>
  <li>Org Moderator</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. What is the difference between the User ID of an administrator and a general user?</strong></p>

<p>User IDs of administrators are not different from any other user. However, the permissions provided to administrators differ from other users.</p>

<p><strong>Q. What data does a content provider see?</strong></p>
