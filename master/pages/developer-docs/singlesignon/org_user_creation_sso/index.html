<h2 id="master-data-interchange">Master Data Interchange</h2>

<p>Sunbird requires some data that currently resides in external SSO systems to provide required functionality to the users who sign in to the platform. For example; in the case of DIKSHA, Sunbird requires data are about organization type (teacher education/training Institutes) and the members of the organizations. Within Sunbird, users are not granted permissions system-wide. User permissions are defined at the level of the organization to which they belong. This allows a user to be a part of many organizations and have different permissions for each organization.</p>

<h3 id="data-requirements">Data Requirements</h3>

<p>To make this feasible, Sunbird requires the following information from the integrating party:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>List of organisations - their names and any unique identifier for them in external system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>List of members for each organisation - the username, full name and verified email address</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>List of roles of each member in the organisation - Available roles are member, content creator and admin</p>
  </li>
</ul>
