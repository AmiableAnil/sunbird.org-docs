<h2 id="telemetry-exhaust-apis">Telemetry Exhaust APIs</h2>

<p>The Sunbird telemetry services are made available through a daily exhaust, supported by Ekstep infra from multiple channels. It is common that, these channels will not have the data pipeline to process the telemetry data. Hence, telemetry are made available to channels.</p>

<p>Steps involved in consuming Data Exhaust:</p>

<ol>
  <li>[Automated] A User need to register using <a href="https://github.com/ekstep/Common-Design/wiki/Data-Exhaust-API-Specification#data-exhaust-register-user-api" target="_blank">Register User API</a>. This API returns a license key, which needs to be used when requesting telemetry data. This creates an entry for the user in <code>data_exhaust_users</code> table.</li>
  <li>[Manual] Access needs to be granted, manually, to this user to the dataset resource that they want to consume. This access is granted by making an entry, for corresponding user and resource, in <code>data_exhaust_users_resources</code> table.</li>
  <li>[Automated] User can then use <a href="https://github.com/ekstep/Common-Design/wiki/Data-Exhaust-API-Specification#data-exhaust-dataset-api" target="_blank">Datasets API</a> to download telemetry data. User has to pass the license key, got in Step 1, for authentication. Internally, Datasets API will invoke <a href="https://github.com/ekstep/Common-Design/wiki/Data-Exhaust-API-Specification#data-exhaust-authenticate-api" target="_blank">Authentication API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ekstep/Common-Design/wiki/Data-Exhaust-API-Specification#data-exhaust-authorize-api" target="_blank">Authorisation API</a> to check if the user has is valid and has access to the requested resource, if the checks pass, dataset is returned.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>Note</code>: Database schema of Data Exhaust is described <a href="https://github.com/ekstep/Common-Design/wiki/TDD-DataSets#database-schema-changes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
