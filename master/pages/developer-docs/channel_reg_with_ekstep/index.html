<p>This page guides you with the necessary steps for registering a channel with Ekstep. Registering a channel is the primary requirement to setup Sunbird functionally. In this context, a channel in Sunbird is a source and conduit of information. It transfers the tenant data from the tenant system to the Ekstep server.
It is must to have your channel registered with Ekstep to access Ekstep Infra. Since, numerous services of Sunbird use Ekstep Infra. Registering a channel also helps in identifying the services accessed by a specific tenant. 
The fundamental purpose of performing this activity is to enable each channel (Root Orgs) to outline and define channel specific content. While registering a Channel, you will get a channel ID. This Channel ID can act as a filter, enable granting and revoking the permissions, manage requests etc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enable the scheduler to find all the missing channels which are not registered in system-settings table</li>

  <li>Upon successful registration of a channel, the flag is set to “true” in system-settings table</li>
</ol>

<p>While the server initializes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As a routine, the scheduler always checks the sync status of system-settings table by checking  the value of “Flag” key</li>
  <li>If sync status of flag key is “false,” it will invoke the process to find the missing channels</li>
  <li>Then [Registering a channel] process will invoke</li>
</ol>
