## Overview

This page provides information for you to install and run a Sunbird instance on your laptop or desktop. The intent is to give you a look and feel of some of the features of Sunbird, be able to tweak around with the front-end code. This developer installation of Sunbird application and the cloud APIs used therein, are not intended for production purposes.

>The Sunbird developer installation can be best viewed via the Google Chrome browser. Although, other browsers may be used, but some pages might not render correctly.

>Sunbird developer installation is intended for the web. It cannot be used on mobile devices and Single Sign On (SSO).  

## Intended Audience

The intended audience of this document is a person who is familiar with installing, configuring, and deploying nodejs based open-source software.

## Prerequisites

1. **Software**: Install the following software: 
   * [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Install the latest release version 8.11.2 LTS series
   * [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - Latest version  
   * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Latest version  
   * [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Install gulp via npm, which gets installed when nodejs is installed

1. **API Keys**
The Sunbird developer instance is powered by cloud hosted Sunbird APIs, which require an API key. To get an API key, please submit an [API Key Request](https://goo.gl/forms/2tRDfLlbJ2IgjWgA2). In the form, give some information about your team and what brings you to Sunbird. It may take up to a couple of business days (India time) to send you the API key. We regret the inconvenience caused due to such delays. 

## System Requirements

To install Sunbird, ensure that your laptop or desktop has the following minimum system requirements:

- Operating System: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 or later, Mac OS X 10.0 and above, or Windows 7 and above
- RAM: > 1.5GB
- CPU: 2 cores (> 2 GHz/core)

## Components Installed

Sunbird installation has two primary software components:
- Portal or web application
- Services stack or the backend API interface

This version installs the portal web application and uses the cloud-hosted services stack

## Set up the Application

These instructions install Sunbird version 1.9. The code examples provided here are Linux based. However, they should not differ when executed on Windows<sup>(R)</sup>. If you face any problems using the Windows<sup>(R)</sup> commandline shell or PowerShell then try using Cygwin<sup>(R)</sup> to install Sunbird on your desktop or laptop.

1. Launch a commandline terminal

1. Ensure that the system PATH variable points to paths where `git`, `node`, `nodemon` and `gulp` are located 
>If you are unable to find an executable by the name of **node**, then try **nodejs**

1. Change directory into the folder which you have designated as the top level folder of the Sunbird application

1. Clone the Sunbird portal github repository

        git clone https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-portal.git

1. Checkout the files tagged with version 1.9

        cd sunbird-portal
        git checkout tags/v1.9 -b 1.9

1. Build the nodejs packages that are required by the Sunbird application

        cd src/app
        gulp download:editors
        npm install
        cd client
        npm install
        
1. Configure the following system environment variables

        | Environment Variable Name |  Value  | Data Type |
        |---------------------------|---------|-----------|
        |  sunbird_environment      | local   |   string  |

        [nodemon] clean exit - waiting for changes before restart

1. Open another commmandline window and run the application server

Populate these system environment variables (again)
