The organization also offers certification courses to candidates. In order to offer such courses, Multiple assets can be grouped together to offer a course.

On successful completion of the course, the course administrator would like to certify employees so that it is easy to know who are the employees who have completed this course.

## Prerequisites

1. The [API Key for access](developre-doc/how-to-guide/gevnerate-apikey) and basic authentication

2. An API client to make API calls. For example use Postman refer [Using Postman](http://www.sunbird.org/apis/framework/#tag/usingpostman)

3. Access to the [Content API](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/apis/content/)

4. Content should be created and available for the course

## Taskflow

The content on Sunbird can be created using [user interface](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/features-documentation/contenteditor/) and through APIs as well. Content in sunbird can be of different types:

1. Courses

2. Collections

3. Resources

4. Lesson Plan
