## Prelude

Before we get into details of how to create a new framework in Sunbird, its important to explain the concepts and differences between a **Taxonomy** and **Framework**. Both a taxonomy and framework describe the same domain. A taxonomy is an arrangement or division according to a predetermined system, while a framework is the resultant catalog that gives freedom for discussion, analysis and information retrieval. The framework extends the knowledge model of a taxonomy. The intent of creating a framework is to enable organizations organize their content in a structure which is easily discoverable. Within Sunbird, the main objective of the framework is to ensure that content creators have an easy interface to tag content with relevant metadata. Appropriate metadata allows user to search for content and get relevant results. Separating the taxonomy from its extension, in the form of framework(s) provides experts and pedagogues the power and flexibility to model and tag content. The framework consists of categories and terms within a specific domain.

Sunbird enables seamless access and discoverability of content through a framework. An organization can use existing framework categories (concepts) and terms (specifications) and further link them to their own framework.

## Scenario
Let us consider an example of an organization, ABC Organization, which works in the domain of water conservation and works with multiple NGOs, village panchayats, and district administration authorities in multiple states of India. They need to create the framework for the water management domain. Their framework will have terms associated with categories specific to the domain. The following example depicts the categories and terms specifically used for the water management framework:

| Framework Name | Categories            | Terms              |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| ABC            |Water Management| Domestic, Industry, Agriculture|
|                |Conservation | Awareness, Rain water harvesting, Recycling Waste Water|
|                |Governance | Policies, Citizens Rights and Duties, Government Programs, Privatization, Water Pricing|
|                |Technologies | Recycling Technologies, Irrigation Technologies, Water Conservation Technologies|
|                |Agriculture | Irrigation, Dams, Ground Water Management, Water Management Practises|
|                |Health | Safe water, Ground Water Contamination, Water Borne Diseases|
|                |Water Directory |                      |	

ABC Organization, may choose a predefined category and associate it to their own framework. Each category in the framework has terms associated with it. These terms are relevant to the created framework and can be created by the organization. 

While creating a new framework, the framework creator needs to set up a new framework and align it to the categories and terms. A category can have terms either in sequential list or in hierarchical structure. Terms can be associated with other terms across categories. As a result, it is possible to select a term in the first category and hence restrict the set of available terms for the next category and so on. The organizations that are adopting Sunbird can link the categories and also change the labels but cannot override or add a new categories on their own. However, the Sunbird instance has the following categories in its predefined frameworks:

```
- Subject: Classification of stream specific values
- Curriculum: Certifying body/stream government or private organization
- Grade Level: Maturity level for knowledge  
- Medium: Language of the course 
- Topic: Details of the concept
```

Send a mail to [Sunbird Team](info@sunbird.org), if you want to create a new master category that is not part of Sunbird's predefined category list. You can however select and rename an existing category
 
For example, for ABC organization the framework name is ABC and code is abc1. The category **Subject** is renamed to **Conservation**. The **Conservation** category defines the various water resources and has the terms as Awareness, Rain water harvesting, Recycling Waste Water and so on. 

## Prerequisites

1. An intialized Sunbird instance with the channel 

2. The [API Key for access](../developer-docs/generating_sunbird_api_keys/) to required APIs and basic authentication
  
3. Software that can make API calls like curl or POSTMAN

4. Creation of the following entities with appropriate access permissions:
   - Admin user (created using Keycloak) who has permissions to create an organization
   - [Individual Organization](../apis/orgapi/#operation/Organisation%20Create)
   - [Individual user](../apis/userapi/#operation/Create%20User) 
   - [Mapping of created user(s) to the organization](../apis/orgapi/#operation/Organisation%20Add%20User)

5. Access to [Framework API](../apis/framework/)

## Taskflow
 
The sequence of tasks the organization administrator follows to create a framework includes:
