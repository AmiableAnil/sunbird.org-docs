## Scenario

Sunbird identifies every tenant organization uniquely through a channel. When creating an organization, in addition, to organization details, Organization ID must be assigned. The organization ID has to be associated with an organization and a channel.

For example: a company, XYZ Corporation, is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 5 locations. Employee training and enablement is one of the core values of the organization. To ensure that employees are regularly trained and upskilled, XYZ Corp has decided to use Sunbird for its learning and training solution. To give employees access to the learning platform, the organization's administrator needs to create an organization. 

John is a manager in XYZ corporation, who can create, review and take courses. He is also an administrator in the system, in which capacity he can add users and assign permissions to them. 

### Prerequisites

1. An intialized Sunbird instance

2. API Key to access Sunbird APIs. To create an API key refer [How to generate a Sunbird API key](../developer-docs/how-to-guide/generate_apikey/)

3. Software that can make API calls like curl or [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation)

4. Access to the [Create Organization API](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/apis/orgapi/#tag/Org-APIs)

### Taskflow

An organization can be created in a Sunbird instance using ORG API, it can be further associated with a user and channel, refer [Mapping User to Organization](../apis/orgapi/#operation/Organisation%20Add%20User). The sequence of tasks the administrator follows to create organization include:

1. Specify values for the following parameters in the request body of the API. Following is an example of request body for creating a user, the sample values provided in the request body are indicative:

#### Request Body for Creating an Organization  

    {
    "request":{
        "orgName":"XYZCorp",
        "description":"Dev Default Org",
        "imgUrl":"N/A",
        "channel":"channel -12571w1sja",
        "preferredLanguage":"English",
        "homeUrl":"N/A",
        "orgCode":"orgCode123sd",
        "isRootOrg":true,
        "provider":"1231rwsadk",
        "externalId":"exts12w7k",
            "address":{
            "city":"Bangalore",
            "state":"KA",
            "country":"INDIA",
            "zipCode":"560000"
            } 
        }
    }

#### Response Body

    {
        "responseCode": "OK",
        "result": {
            "organisationId": "012567820191629312269",
            "response": "SUCCESS"
            } 
    }
   
2. Save the created organization ID. The organization ID is utilized while [Mapping a user to an organization](http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/how-to-guide/associating_organization_and_user)  

3. An organization is created in Sunbird

### Concepts Covered

**Users**: The individual who can sign in and access the Sunbird portal to perform a set of action that is assigned by the system administrator.

**Organization**: Organizations can be an institute or a body of individuals. 

**Channel**: Unique identification number associated with the user or an organization

**Root Organization**: All users and sub-organization in an organisation are associated through the rootOrg

**System Administrator**: A user who manages end-to-end system from creating an organization, administrators for the organizations, members within the organization, and assign roles to the members
