## Scenario

XYZ Corp, is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 7 locations. Employee training and enablement is one of the core values of the organization. Before the organization opted to use the Sunbird platform, employees accessed another legacy system that to train and upskill themselves. 

The legacy system has a large repository of content artifacts. These artifacts have to be uploaded into Sunbird so that employees can access them, even through Sunbird.

The organization also creates content artifacts and courses using multiple resources on an ongoing basis. Content and course creators also need to upload all such new content into Sunbird.  


## Prerequisites

* Content creation access
* Content artifacts with a unique object ID
* API Authorization Key


## Intended Audience

* **Content Creator**: Users who have permissions to create, manage, and upload content artifacts
* **Content Reviewer**: Users who have permissions to review and publish content artifacts

> Note: Reviewers cannot change any content. They can only send review comments to content creators for modifications or publish the content artifact directly, if no modifications are required.


## Overview

Sunbird allows you to assign users with roles that have appropriate permissions to create, store, upload or consume content. Users with content creation rights can create and upload content on Sunbird.

Currently, the Sunbird platform supports the following content formats:

* Text (.pdf)
* Audio (.mp3)
* Images (.jpeg, .png)
* Video (.mp4, .webm, YouTube URLs)
* HTML
* ECML (created using the inbuilt content editor)
* EPUB
* H5P

> Note: Additional file formats will be supported in future versions of Sunbird. 

Sunbird validates every content artifact that is uploaded using metadata. Hence, it is mandatory to tag each file with the following metadata before it is uploaded:

- Content Type
- Mime Type 

You can upload video content owned by others, if:

* you have the required permissions from the original creator
* it adheres to prescribed content guidelines
* it is in the accepted file format
* it is within the prescribed size limit


## Taskflow

To upload new or existing content (that is not created using Sunbird's inbuilt content editor) on to Sunbird, use the [Upload Content API](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/apis/content/#operation/Upload%20Content). Before you upload the content, ensure that it is appropriately tagged with metadata and ownership information. 

### Uploading Content Using API

* The [Upload Content API](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/apis/content/#operation/Upload%20Content) endpoint executes the **Upload Content** request based on validated content metadata associated with the uploaded file

> Sample URL: https://staging.open-sunbird.org/api/content/v1/upload/business_process.pdf

* Get a valid unique value in the **contentId** field of API URL by making a [Create Content API](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/apis/content/#operation/Create%20Content) request before making an **Upload Content** request. 

* Specify values for the mandatory form data parameters
