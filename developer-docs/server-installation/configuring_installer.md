## Installation Procedure

To install Sunbird, **choose one docker swarm manager as the installation server**, SSH to that server and execute the instructions explained in this section.

> In a two server setup, execute the following steps from the server designated to run the application server

## Getting the Installer

* Clone the installer repository from github.com and checkout the release branch using the following commands:

        git clone https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops.git
        cd sunbird-devops
        git checkout tags/release-1.9
        cd deploy

> Note: Do not use 10.0.0.0 network subnet. The docker uses this subnet for internal communications and thus this may result in a clash with the host IPs.

## Configuring the Installer

You can update the configuration parameters in the `sunbird-devops/deploy/config` file. The config file is a YAML file. 

> **Note**: If you are running a two-server installation, you only need to fill in the BASIC section of the config file and can leave the advanced section as is.
