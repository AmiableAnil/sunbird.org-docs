## Overview
This page explains the jobs to be run to bring up the Core services. 

## Prerequisites

1.Create a container in the Azure blob and make it public to publish content. The container name must be the same as the variable **sunbird_content_azure_storage_container** specified in the **common.yml** file present in the core inventory.

2.Switch to the `Build` folder and run all jobs. Set the value for **github_release_tag** according to the details mentioned in this page - [Current Release Tags and Jenkins Jobs Reference](developer-docs/server-installation/current_release_tags_n_jenkins_jobs){:target="_blank"}

## Running the Jobs
    
> Note: Adhere to the following sequence when running the jobs.

### DevOps Administration

| Operation Name | Function |
|--------------------|-----------| 
| Bootstrap | Creates Deployer User | 
| SwarmBootstrap | Creates Swarm with manager and agent nodes |

### Builds

| Build Name | Function |
|--------------------|-----------| 
| Adminutils | Builds the Adminutils docker image |
| API MANAGER | Builds the API manager docker image | 
| API MANAGER Echo | Builds the API manager echo docker image | 
| Badger | Builds the badger docker image |
| Cassandra | Creates a jar for migration. Build this twice - There are two tags mentioned on the tags page for this. |
| CassandraTrigger | Builds  the cassandra trigger jar file |
| Lms | Builds  the lms service docker image |
| Content | Builds the content service docker image | 
| Learner | Builds the learner service docker image | 
| Player | Builds the player service docker image. In the build job you have 3 parameters which point to plugins. Provide the values of your blob url where the zip files are uploaded. For details refer [Plugins build page](developer-docs/server-installation/plugins){:target="_blank"} |
| Cert | Builds cert service docker image |
| EncService | Build the envservice docker image |
| Proxy | Builds the proxy docker image |  
| Telemetry | Builds the telemetry docker image |

### Artifacts  
Ensure that all Artifacts are uploaded

### Provision

| Operation Name | Function |
|--------------------|-----------| 
| (Deploy) ApplicationES | From the Deploy Folder, **Deploy ApplicationES** provisions for the Elasticsearch and creates indices necessay for Sunbird Core|
| ESMapping (Under OpsAdministarion. Provide value as *all* for job parameter indices_name) | Creates Elasticsearch indexes |
| Postgres | Provisions for Postgres |
| PostgresDbUpdate | Creates the databases, assigns roles and creates users |
| LogEsUpgrade6xx | Install elasticsearch 6.X |

### Deploy

| Operation Name | Function |
|--------------------|-----------| 
| Adminutil | Deploys the Adminutil container | 
| API Manager | Deploys the API manager Kong and API manager Echo | 
| OnboardAPIS | Onboards all API's to Sunbird | 
| OnboardConsumers 
Update **core_vault_sunbird_api_auth_token**, **core_vault_kong__test_jwt** and **core_vault_sunbird_ekstep_api_key** with the **jwt token** from the Jenkins output of **api-management-test-user** if you are using the Knowledge Platform and Data Pipeline along with core| Onboards new consumer to Sunbird and generates the consumer specific API key. |   
| (Provision) Cassandra | Provisions Cassandra and create keyspaces required for Sunbird Core | 
| Cassandra | Does migration if required. Deploy this thrice by choosing different zip files using the build_number parameter. Ensure that you get a sucess message for the Cassandra migration on the Jenkins console output. Do not rely only on the red or green status indicator on Jenkins job | 
| CassandraTrigger | Deploys trigger jars for Cassandra |  
| (Provision) Keycloak | Provisions Keycloak by installing prerequisites like Java and environment variables |  
| PlayerCDN | If you do not want to use CDN, run this job with Jenkins job parameter **cdn_enable** set to false (default). CDN  increases the performance of the web page and content for the end user. Create CDN with the storage account and update the variable **sunbird_portal_cdn_url**. Set the Jenkins job parameter **cdn_enable** to true. This upload player static contents to CDN storage account. | 
| Player | Deploys the player service, used to display the App frontend. **Note**: The player deployment job will fail for the first time. Jenkins prompts you for **In process Approval Script**. Click on the approval link in the deploy job page and provide explicit approval for new **java.io** file, **java.lang** string and **java.io** file. Run the Player deployment again.|
| Proxy | Deploys Proxy. Handles routing within the swarm | 
| Keycloak | Deploys Keycloak service to VM |  
| KeycloakRealm | Creates Sunbird Realm. After the Sunbird realm is created, configure Keycloak by using the steps mentioned in the **Keycloak Configuration** section. |
| Learner | Deploys the Learner Service. Handles user management and helps to search content. |
| Content | Deploys the content service. Helps to create content. |
| Lms | Deploys the Lms Service. It provides the APIs for lms functionality of Sunbird.| 
| certTemplate | Uploads static certification template to storage |
| EncService | Deploys the encryption service. Helps to generate the encryption keys |
| Cert | Deploys the certificate service. Helps to issue the certificates |
| Telemetry | Deploys the Telemetry service. Helps in sending telemetry to Kafka|


### Keycloak Configuration 

> Note: From release-2.0.0 keycloak admin portal is disabled from public internet. 
You must tunnel the port in to the local machine via ssh tunnelling.  
`ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 ops@~keycloak-ip-address~`  
You can access keycloak via `localhost:8080`

| Step | Action  |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Login to Keycloak using the user name **admin** and password as given in the private **secrets.yml** file. Or, login to keycloak using &#60;localhost:8080&#62;/auth |
| 2 | Navigate to Sunbird Realm > Realm Settings > Keys. Click `Public Key`. Copy the key value that you see and update the variable core_vault_sso_public_key |
| 3 | Creating keycloak federation [Deployment Steps for Keycloak User Federation](developer-docs/server-installation/keycloak_user_federation) |


**Note:**
If the Cassandra migration fails, run the query manually to set the corresponding version for the failed migration to True

**Example:**

`SELECT * from sunbird.cassandra_migration_version;`

Check the rows for which the value in the success column is False. The following is an example -

`1.80 |   180685665 |   cassandra |              4 |         null | 2019-12-01 13:58:52.401000+0000 |            136 | V1.80_cassandra.cql |   False |  CQL |           80`

Run the update query for each row separately 

`update sunbird.cassandra_migration_version set success=True where version ='1.80';`

Verify that all the values in the success column are True and rerun the Jenkins job again with same zip file and tag

Once this succeeds, use the second zip file and tag to deploy again

The current migration version is 1.88. The output of the Jenkins job should be as follows -

`Migrating keyspace Sunbird to version 1.88 - Cassandra
Successfully applied 3 migrations to keyspace sunbird (execution time 00:20.547s).
Migration Completed at ==1571996508540`
