## Overview
Some of the user details is unencrypted in sunbird system, this job will identify those user and will create an csv file which contain the user ids of unencrypted user.

## Prerequisites

To run the migration script, ensure you have:

1. Access to cassandra database
2. A backup of sunbird keyspace in Cassandra DB.

## Configuration Parameters
The following parameters needs to be passed as arguments for the identifying unencrypted users data job

 S.No. | Parameter | Description | Example 
-------|-----------|-------------|---------
1 | cassandra_server | Cassandra DB IP Address| 198.168.1.1
2 | cassandra_port | Cassandra DB Port Number | 9042 
3 | cassandra_keyspace  | Cassandra DB Keyspace Name | demodb 
4 | user_id_csv_file_path | Path to CSV file where user ids are stored | \home\userids.csv


## Script

To identify unencrypted user data from cassandra:

1. Extract the archive file (sunbird-utils/cassandra-migration-etl/common/IdentifyUnencryptedUserIdsBin.zip) that contains the script for identifying unencrypted user data.

2. Run the following command to identify unencrypted user data
<pre> 
IdentifyUnencryptedUserIds_run.sh --context_param cassandra_keyspace="{keyspace_name}" --context_param cassandra_port="{cassandra_port}" --context_param cassandra_server="{cassandra_server_ip}" --context_param user_id_csv_file_path="{user_id_csv_file_path}"
</pre>
3. On successful completion, the csv containing user ids is available in the configured file {user_id_csv_file_path}

4. To cross-check whether it fetched only those user ids whose data is unecrypted run below query with the user ids in csv

 - Query to fetch user 
     ```select * from user where id = '{user-id}';```
